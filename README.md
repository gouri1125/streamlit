# streamlit
This Streamlit web application demonstrates basic user interaction, data visualization, and machine learning integration. The app collects user details such as name, age, gender, date of birth, and hobbies, displays sample data using interactive tables and charts, and visualizes age distribution with a scatter plot. Additionally, it includes an Iris species prediction module where users can input flower measurements and receive real-time predictions using a pre-trained machine learning model. The application is designed to showcase Streamlit’s UI components, data handling, and ML model deployment in a simple and interactive way.
